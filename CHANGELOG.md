## [2.0.0] - 2022-07-25
- BREAKING: Moved: ALL code from namespace `Bore` and to namespaces `Ore` and `Ore.Editor`.
- Moved: `Editor/Drawers.cs` -> `Editor/OGUI.cs` (associated functions are now also nested as appropriate).

- Added: `Ore.Editor.Styles` <- tried to not go too deep on this API / default usage.

- Added: Safe and defensive API for file IO (Static/Filesystem.cs)
- Added: DeviceSpy (e.g. used by LAUD deciders)
- Added: ActiveScene (Scene singleton) (useful for starting Coroutines from anywhere)
