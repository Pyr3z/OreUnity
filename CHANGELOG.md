---
## [2.4.0] - 2022-10-14
- Adopted: DeviceDimensions.cs (from Decisions package).

## [2.3.3] - 2022-10-10
- HashMaps: Fixed: Rare linear probing issue causing large hashmaps (N>10,000) to map collisions incorrectly.
- HashMaps: Optimized - tests are now within 1% of the speed of Dictionary/Hashtable

## [2.3.2] - 2022-10-06
- Removed stubs for APIs that aren't functional from the release track (issue #1).

## [2.3.1] - 2022-10-05
- Added: HashMap data structure !!!! (This is a _somewhat_ major feature addition)
- Added: Unit tests for Filesystem + HashMap + competing System implementations.

## [2.2.1] - 2022-09-12
- Fixed: SceneLord.LoadSceneAsync now has safety guards against spamming.
- Changed: SceneLord is no longer a required OAssetSingleton and can be created via the Asset menu.
- Changed: VersionID internals are now smarter.
- Added: (Editor-only) Property drawer for VersionIDs, does some validation, allows editing the underlying string.
- Fixed: More annoying OAssetSingleton warnings / failed asserts.
- Fixed: My head.

## [2.2.0] - 2022-08-25
- Removed: Automatic OAssetSingleton<> instantiations by default. You can still flag an OAssetSingleton for auto-creation at a specific path by using the [AssetPath(string)] type attribute.
- Added: Public API for asset creation, work either at runtime or edit time: OAsset.Create(...)
- Added: OAssetSingleton.TryGuarantee(out TSelf) - used to absolutely guarantee that you'll get an instance, even if one must be created. The only case where this fails is when the system is out of memory (in theory).
- Added: SceneLord OAssetSingleton - it's a helper for calling SceneManager functions from with serialized Unity Events (etc).

## [2.1.4] - 2022-08-24
- Fixed: Orator now only uses rich text in Editor, not in builds (i.e. Android Logcat).

## [2.1.3] - 2022-08-20
- Fixed: DelayedEvent fields on ScriptableObjects work (more) properly.

## [2.1.2] - 2022-08-19
- Fixed: DelayedEvent now uses ActiveScene properly to enqueue coroutines before scene load.
- Added: new Orator.LogOnce (etc) API prevents annoying spam in your logs.
- Fixed: Dependency loop issue after fresh pull.
- Removed: IImmortalSingleton. It was folly.
- Added: Attribute [AssetPath] for specifying custom paths for automatic OAssetSingleton creation.
- Added: A more complete Coroutine API for ActiveScene.
- Added: GreyLists, SerialSets
- Fixed: DelayedEvent in ScriptableObjects

## [2.0.2] - 2022-08-15
- Fixed: Defunct behaviour on Orator assets (and all other OAssetSingletons)
- Added: Certain attributes disable automatic OAssetSingleton creation: [CreateAssetMenu], [Obsolete], [OptionalAsset].
- Changed: All OAssetSingletons get auto-created in the root-level Resources folder.

## [2.0.1] - 2022-08-12
- Fixed: OAssert preventing builds
- Added: OAssert.Exists(), etc
- Fixed: EditorBridge warning, something something about namespaces 

## [2.0.0] - 2022-07-25
- BREAKING: Moved: ALL code from namespace `Bore` and to namespaces `Ore` and `Ore.Editor`.
- Moved: `Editor/Drawers.cs` -> `Editor/OGUI.cs` (associated functions are now also nested as appropriate).
- Added: `Ore.Editor.FoldoutHeader` + tested it on `DelayedEvent`'s custom property drawer.
- Added: `Ore.Editor.Styles` <- tried to not go too deep on this API / default usage.
- Added: the `Orator` & `OAssert` APIs, should be ready for most use cases now!
- Improved: `DelayedEvents`, `Orator`, pre-existing editor utilities.
- Fixed: all editor warnings.


## [1.1.0] - 2022-06-23
- Added: Editor helpers simplified and migrated from Levi's PyroDK.
- Refactor: Package structure (public C# interface is (mostly) unaffected).
- Added: Simplified versions of PyroDK static utilities (Bitwise.cs, Integers.cs, Floats.cs, Hashing.cs, etc)
- Added: Safe and defensive API for file IO (Static/Filesystem.cs)
- Added: DeviceSpy (e.g. used by LAUD deciders)
- Added: ActiveScene (Scene singleton) (useful for starting Coroutines from anywhere)


## [1.0.0] - 2022-05-17
- Moved all the boilerplate code in the now-deprecated "Bore" package into this "Ore" package.
